# Simple-Sketches
Snippets and simple sketches I have put together

Feel free to use these for whatever purpose you chose. 

I make no warranties that the included codes work or will even
compile for you. Snippets are just that. Full sketches compiled 
for me on my machine and worked >>> AS I WANTED <<< at the time 
they were uploaded to GitHub. Most, if not all, ino files included
in my repository were written by me. They may or may not be written
in the most elegant or efficient manner. But they work for me.
